Welcome to my Spotify API App. This full-stack spotify app allows users to
discover artist avalible on the Spotify platform. As the user you will be able
to click the image for the artist and be redirected to Spotify to view and
listen to albums and songs from that artist.

## Features

  as well as similar artist.
- **Link to spotify**: Each artist has a direct link to the artist profile on
  Spotify.

  features for building web and mobile applications
- **Mongoose**: A JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a
  connection between MongoDB and the Node. js JavaScript runtime environment
- **CORS**: A browser security feature that allows a web application to access
  resources from a different domain than the one that served the page
- **nodemon**: A command-line tool that automatically restarts a Node.js
  application when it detects changes to files in the project directory
